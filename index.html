        <h2>What is FreshSense?</h2>
        <p>FreshSense is a simple, easy-to-use system that “smells” the air inside mushroom farms. Imagine a small device, about the size of your hand, quietly 
            working in the corner of a grow room. <br><br>It reads the air every second, looking for unusual odors that may signal problems such as mold, bad bacteria, or issues 
            with the growing material. Once FreshSense detects something unusual, it sends a quick alert to the farmer’s phone. This means the farmer can take
            action right away—long before the problem becomes visible. <br><br>FreshSense acts like a “nose that never sleeps,” helping farmers protect their harvest 24 hours a day.</p>

    <article>
        <h2>Why Smell Matters in Mushroom Farming?</h2>
        <p>Most mushroom problems start quietly. Before mold becomes green, or before bacteria spreads, they release tiny smells that humans cannot notice. These 
            smells show up hours or even days before any visible signs appear. <br><br>Farmers usually discover problems when it’s too late—when mushrooms look sick, 
            when the trays turn strange colors, or when the room begins to smell odd. At this point, the contamination has already spread. FreshSense solves this by detecting early smells that are invisible and 
            impossible to notice without technology. It gives farmers a “head start,” allowing them to stop problems early and save most—or even all—of the harvest.</p>

        <h2>How FreshSense Works</h2>
        <h4>1. A Smart Odor Sensor</h4>
        <p>This is the small device placed in mushroom growing rooms. It checks the air for certain smells that are known to be early signs of trouble. It doesn’t need water, sunlight, or complicated setup—just place it and turn it on.</p>
        <h4>2. A Mobile App for Farmers</h4>
        <p>The app shows what FreshSense is detecting. If the air is clean and healthy, everything will appear green. If something unusual starts to happen, the app changes color and sends a message like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“Warning: Possible mold activity in Room 2.”</li>
            <li>“Alert: Air quality changing—check humidity or ventilation.” </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Everything is designed to be easy to understand so any farmer, no matter their background, can use it comfortably. </p>

            <h2>What makes FreshSense Different?</h2>
            <p>FreshSense is not just another sensor. It is built specifically for mushroom farms. Traditional farm sensors only measure temperature and humidity. 
                FreshSense goes beyond that by focusing on <b>smell</b>, which is the earliest sign of contamination. <br><br>Other tools detect problems late—FreshSense detects them early. 
                <br><br>That difference means the farmer has time to react, time to save the harvest, and time to prevent bigger losses.</p>
